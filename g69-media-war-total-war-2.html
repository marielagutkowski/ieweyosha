A recent thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/aww33f/reddit_scrambles_to_explain_why_the_ottomans_were/) at r/badhistory, is absolutely that, bad history.

TL;DR: Lots of teams claim lots of national championships for lots of reasons with lots of evidentiary sources. Edit: Added the key at the bottom. Edit 2: Added a list of my errors to the bottom. It was bound to happen. This post is going to be long. In several places I've replaced tables in the text with links to images of the tables to help. There’s just a lot to cover in 150 years.

Edit: I was contacted by Zheani on reddit. She requested that I remove the Google Drive link due to it being revenge pornography. I disagree on the notion of it being revenge pornography, as it wasn't posted within the context of an intimate relationship. It could fall under copyright infringement, but I don't know Australian copyright law. In any case, I've removed it at the request of the moderators wanting to keep the sub SFW. I still have the link. Edit 2: Link has been removed ((This is a crosspost I put into WotB. At the suggestion of others, I put it here.

When I was 18 I joined the US Air Force. It was a logical choice, I didn't come from a prestigious background. I wasn't great at sports, didn't really achieve any scholarships, and the military seemed like the best option. I’ll never forget my mom’s reaction. I enlisted right around the time of the height of the Iraq War. She was so scared for me, and I was young, brave and stupid.
